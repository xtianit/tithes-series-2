                    The controversy and dissatisfaction rising severally from
                    the issue of tithing are all resulting from insufficient
                    knowledge of history. Although some of it could be
                    attributed to selfishness, a greater degree is to the

                        Our text reveals the ancient and divine history of
                        tithing, dating back to Melchizedek and Abraham. It
                        predates the Mosaic Law, continues through the New
                        Testament, and remains eternal as long as there is a
                        Priest. Christ, our eternal High Priest in the order of
                        Melchizedek, guides this truth (Hebrews 5:6). Let us
                        explore the different periods when tithing has been
                        practiced.
